***All code by Trevor Bohl, this time with a caffeine dependancy possibly even greater***

***COMPILATION***
Similar to last assignment, the entire project can be compile with a simple 'make' command, and 'make clean' to remove excess object files. 
It will compile to an executable called "RBT" and create an obj directory if one does not already exist.

***INPUT***
The program expects either the name of an input file passed to the command line, or it will open a file called "input.txt".
I have provided a sample input file to demonstrate formatting.
